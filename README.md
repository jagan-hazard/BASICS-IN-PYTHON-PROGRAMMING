#BASICS-IN-PYTHON-PROGRAMMING
------------------------------

  1. An Introduction
  -------------------
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.
It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
It is open source software, well documented and vast community to support you. Python is well used in the following fields,
		
	Machine Learning and AI,
	Developing GUI apps,
	Games and 3D graphics,
	Scientific and Numerics,
	Used as scripting language and go on.

It has vast libraries and packages that will help you in anywhere, few notable libraries in python are,

	Data Science - Numpy,NLTK,Matplotlib,scipy,pandas, etc,
	Web Scrapping - Scrapy, Beautiful soup, etc,	GUI Development -PyQT,Kivy, etc.
		
	  2. Basic Elements in Python
  -----------------------------
    2.1. Variables, Identifiers and Keywords
    ----------------------------------------
  		2.1.1. Variables:
  		-----------------
  		   - Variables are reserved locations in a computer memory to store values.
  		   - we can store data type such as integer,strings,list, etc in a variable.
  		   - variables are stored in stack and their values are stored in heap.
  		   - It does have value,scope,type,scope, etc.
  		   - Python supports Dynamic Typing i.e. Dynamic memory allocation.(Hope you know about stack and heap)

  		    e.g:
  		    		a=10;
  		    		list1=[4,5,3,2,1]
  		    		dic1={1:'jagan',2:'nathan'}
  		    	Here, a,list1,dic1 are variables which holds some values.

  		2.1.2. Identifiers:
  		-------------------
  			- Identifier is the name given to entities like variables,functions,objects etc.
  			- The name of the variable is an identifier.
  			- It doesn't have value,scope,type,scope, etc.

  			Rules for identifier

  				- Case sensitive,
  				- Only Number,letters and underscore is allowed rest of the keywords are not allowed.
  		
  		2.1.3. Keywords:
  		----------------
  			- Keywords are predefined names used as syntax for certain function, loops.
  			- Keywords can't be used in any other ways, otherwise it's a error.

  			e.g:
  					function a:
  						...
  						if ():
  							...
  						...

  				function,if,else,while,for class int,list,tuple,in are some of the keywords in python.
